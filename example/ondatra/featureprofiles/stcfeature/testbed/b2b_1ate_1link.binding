# proto-message: openconfig.testing.Binding

# This is an example static binding that demonstrates how to specify
# options to be used in conjunction with the atedut_*.testbed
# testbeds.

# These options are inherited throughout the entire binding for both the
# DUT and the ATE, unless overridden by a specific device or protocol.
options {
  username: "admin"
  password: "spirent123"
}

ates {
  id: "ate"
  name: "labserver"  # Change this to the labserver hostname.

  # This option specific to OTG. 
  otg {
    target: "10.61.37.199:50051" # Change this to the otg server endpoint.
    insecure: true
    timeout: 600
  }

  gnmi {
     target: "10.61.37.199:50052"  # Change this to the gnmi server endpoint.
     insecure: true
     timeout: 600
  }

  # Before this binding can be used with a topology, add ports mapping
  # from its topology ID to the actual port name on the device.
  ports {
    id: "port1"
    name: "//10.61.37.186/1/1"  # Change this to the port location.
  }
  ports {
    id: "port2"
    name: "//10.61.37.186/1/2"  # Change this to the port location.
  }
